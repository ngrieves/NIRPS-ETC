Make sure to update the stellar templates first and then add the stellar template file into the old_files directory. Along with the effs and tapas files

Run update_effs.py to create the new input files in the updated_files directory
Add these files into the overall input directory

***** MAKE SURE SAMPLING IS SAME FOR THE tapas effs AND STAR_templates files *****
